Welcome to my portfolio. Within these pages, you can journey through my array of projects, ranging from the very first PC I built by hand to my most recent endeavors, which include developing a prototype aimed at improving user navigation in video streaming platforms. Detailed explorations and resolutions of various challenges encountered along the way are provided as instructional guides in the blog section.
