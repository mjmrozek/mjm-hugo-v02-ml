**Context**  
- Scaling the originally small, private project P7 into a comprehensive business model with blog posts, a YouTube channel, and free and paid membership areas for tasks and exercises.

</br></br>  

**Objectives etc.**
- The target group—students, university students, and adults in further education—finds practical solutions starting from specific problems through our YouTube videos followed by tasks and exercises.
    - For example, a student faces the challenge of learning a large amount of data for his first exam. His previous method of rote memorization is no longer effective. A Google or YouTube search leads him to our channel "meta-skills" and to the video "Art of Memory: The Loki Method". In just 5 to 10 minutes, he learns the basics of an effective mnemonic technique. He then switches to the associated blog post, deepens his understanding through additional sketches and tasks, and consolidates his understanding with a final exercise. Finally, he successfully applies the new technique in his exam preparation.
- Revenue is generated through YouTube monetization and an optional, paid area on the platform.
