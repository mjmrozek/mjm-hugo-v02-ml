**Disclaimer**  
The content on my website is created with care, yet I cannot guarantee its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.

I am not responsible for any content linked or referred to from my pages on external platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube, as I have no control over them. The respective operators are accountable for their content.

Should any legal infringement become known to me, I will remove the offending content promptly.

Personal data provided to me through contact inquiries is solely used to respond to these inquiries. Any further use only occurs with explicit consent.

I welcome the sharing and discourse surrounding my work. Should you choose to share or discuss my content, please do so responsibly, with proper credit to me as the source and author.

Commercial exploitation of my content without my explicit permission is strictly forbidden. This includes any sales or monetization efforts involving my work without due credit.

**AI Collaboration Disclosure**  
I engage with advanced AI tools, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, to aid in the creation and refinement of content across my platforms. While I may present these contributions as part of my own body of work, I believe in transparency regarding the use of AI in my creative process.

The content enhanced by AI spans various formats and can be found on my websites as well as social media channels. These AI-enhanced writings also inform multimedia content, like my YouTube videos.

Rather than categorize the extent of AI involvement, I recognize that AI is an integral tool in the modern creative landscape, providing assistance that ranges from basic language corrections to more substantial compositional support. Regardless of the level of AI assistance, the pursuit of authenticity and originality in my work is a constant, and I am committed to ensuring that the essence of the content is genuinely reflective of my perspectives and insights.

Please consider that the integration of AI in my work is done thoughtfully, with a discerning eye toward maintaining the integrity of my voice and the quality of my content.  

Despite the term 'tool,' it is by no means intended in a derogatory sense, but rather reflects the practical role of AI in my creative process. The homepage contains a relevant overarching explanation.
