**Context:** 
- Initially in my IT activities, I only possessed basic knowledge in web design. The main goal was a quickly realizable web presence to represent myself, my services (support, data protection), and my portfolio. Hence, I chose WordPress.com for CMS, hosting, domain, and email.
- A switch to IONOS' unmanaged WordPress was made to gain more control and customization options and to reduce costs.
- Ultimately, two separate WordPress installations were run: one on a German server for the German version and one on a Californian server for the English version (the disadvantages of a multisite or automatic translations were significant...)
- Concerns arose about the accessibility of both sites due to plugin errors or compatibility issues after updates.  
- The increasing effort required to maintain both WordPress installations led to the realization that a single, static, and multilingual site would be preferable.

**Goals:**  
- Enhancement of server performance and transition from WordPress to a sleek, static website.
- Introduction of an efficient and cost-effective backup system.
- Flexibility in migration.
- Increase in website speed (target: Google PageSpeed score of 100).
- Elevation of security.
- Reduction of maintenance effort to a minimum.
- Stability and reliability of the entire web presence, even in the event of server failures.
- Reduction/consolidation of my online presence to a single address for the website and emails.

**Plan (rough):**  
First Phase (Pre-IPFS)
- Content and structural transfer from the existing German website (WordPress to the HUGO framework) and local testing.
- Setting up the second language (English)
- Connecting GitHub with Netlify and deploying with my own domain (mjmrozek.com) and redirecting from mjmrozek.de there.
- Frontend fine-tuning.  

Second Phase (IPFS / ICP)
- Setting up Oracle Cloud Compute with Ubuntu, Remote Desktop, and there VSC, due to proven issues with Silicon builds on Fleek
- Replacing Netlify with Fleek and using mjmrozek.eth and IPFS hosting/pinning only

- mjmrozek.eth (ETH domain via ENS) 
- ETHERMAIL
- IPFS as hosting/pinning  

**Implementation / Protocol (for the second phase):**
- 4 main steps: Create a Decentralized Website | ENS Support
- The nickname "mjmrozek" shall be at the center of my online identity or web3 identity overall 
- Setting up Metamask and linking it to Google Chrome
- Purchase of ETH worth about 100 EUR via credit card
- Acquisition of the web3-username "mjmrozek" via ENS (https://app.ens.domains/) for 5 years for about 50 EUR.
    - Entry of 5 records (more will be added later)
        - url: https://mjmrozek.com
        - name (nickname): mjmrozek
