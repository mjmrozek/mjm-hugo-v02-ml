Hetzner is incredibly cheap, the hardware is good, and availability is also high. However, the UI is outdated, user-friendliness is lacking, service is "okay," and internal documentation is incomplete. BUT the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages! Starting from EUR 2.09/month (with a monthly plan), you get a domain, SSL, email, backup, etc. Since the initial setup can be difficult, I'll give a rough overview.

### Steps to Set Up

#### 1. Open an Account
- Open an account via hetzner.com
- Log in to KonsoleH
- New Order
- Scroll to Webhosting and select Level 1

#### 2. Select Domain
- Select a domain (.de, .com, .org, etc. are included in the price)
- Choose "I want to register a domain"
- Enter domain owner and domain admin details

#### 3. Access Files
- Access files in the browser via "Extras" and "WebFTP"

#### 4. Install WordPress
- Install WordPress via "Extras" and "WP"
- Select "Install WP"
- Ignore the warning about overwriting files and click "Continue"
- WordPress will be installed by Hetzner
- Message: "WP was successfully installed..."
- Continue to "Set up WP"

#### 5. Set Up WP
- Enter title (meineseite.de), notification email (existing, personal email address), username (for logging into WP backend, e.g., "admin_john"), and generate a password to note down (e.g., in a password manager)
- Message: "WP was successfully set up..." and the username and password are displayed

#### 6. Add SSL Certificate
- Continue to "Extras" and "SSL Manager"
- Add "Lets encrypt" for free
- "Issue a new certificate for" â€“ the new domain should already be selected
- Proceed without a subdomain and click "Request"
- The request may take some time
- Message: "Certificate was successfully created..."
- In "SSL Manager" under "SSL Accounts," assign the certificate to the new domain (install the certificate - drop-down menu - bottom entry (lets encrypt))
- Activate HTTPS forwarding

#### 7. Test Website
- Call up the page in the browser "https://meineseite.de"
- The default WP theme should be visible, and a closed lock symbol should appear to the left of the address bar
- Append "wp-admin" to the domain (https://meineseite.de/wp-admin)
- Enter the username and password from step 5
- Settings - General - WP address: correct to https (only http is entered)
- WP website address: correct to https (only http is entered)
- Save changes

#### 8. Set Up Email
- Back to Hetzner KonsoleH
- Email - Email Addresses - Mailboxes - "New Mailbox"
- Enter the name of the mailbox, e.g., "info" for "info@meineseite.de"
- Create and note down a password
- Access emails via Webmail
