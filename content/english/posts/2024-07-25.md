## Apple Magic Mouse
- When will Apple finally release a new mouse? No other mouse offers such smooth scrolling! I don't want the Magic Mouse developed ages ago with its impractical charging port on the bottom.

## Free Music for Videos
- For free music for videos, I now also use Chosic.com; Previously, incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html was my first choice
    - Always check if free use is allowed, but the artist may need to be credited: For example, under a YouTube video

## WordPress Security and Optimization

### Hide Backend Access
- The standard access to the backend (WP dashboard) is https://mysite.com/wp-admin; with the plugin "WPS Hide Login", it can be replaced by any secret address, such as https://mysite.com/secretaccess ("wp-admin" replaced by "secretaccess")
    - To do this: Plugins - Add New Plugin - WPS Hide Login - install - activate - Settings - enter custom address (login URL) here and be sure to note / save it

### Plugin Management
- Unused plugins should be deactivated or better yet deleted
    - Often / usually two anti-spam plugins are pre-installed

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Security is further enhanced by 2FA
    - WP Dashboard - Plugins - Add New Plugin - Search for "AIOS" and "All-In-One Security" - install - activate - Settings - Two-Factor Authentication - 2FA should be available for all user roles - Activate 2FA (from deactivated to activated, once QR is scanned and 2FA app on phone and WP show the same digit code!)
    - The standard app for 2FA is Google Authenticator, although I recommend Twilio's Authy for backup and multi-device support

### User Management
- In addition to the admin of a site with full access, there should also be, for example, an author who is only allowed to write blog posts and whose rights do not allow changing settings or plugins. As an admin, you should only log in when you actually need to perform administrative tasks
- After setting up the new, secret login URL and 2FA, additional users should be created with rights restricted to only what they need to perform their tasks - no one should have more rights than necessary.

### Backup Solution
- Although in the case of mjmrozek-automation.com with Hetzner as host, a simple backup solution exists, an individual backup solution should be set up here and in general. Backups are important to revert to older, error-free versions in case of malfunction or if the site is damaged after an attack, etc.
    - Plugins - Add New Plugin - Search "UpdraftPlus: WP Backup" - install - activate - don't create backup immediately (don't press "Backup Now") but first adjust settings
        - Settings within the plugin - Set file backup schedule (e.g., monthly with max 2) and database backup schedule (e.g., daily with max 30)
        - If necessary, exclude file extensions like mp3 from being backed up if these are already saved offline on your own computer or external hard drive, etc., as audio or video files can quickly make backups very large 
        - For the online storage location of backups, don't choose your own host but e.g., Google Drive (free)
            - Go through the authentication process with Google: Select account (e.g., xxx@gmail.com), allow access to everything, "complete setup"
        - Depending on the backup interval set earlier, the next scheduled backup is now displayed (WP Dashboard - Settings - UpdraftPlus - Backup / Restore; alternatively press "Backup Now" for testing purposes)

## Hardware Recommendation for Mobile Work
- For mobile work via LTE, I can highly recommend the Netgear Nighthawk M1
    - At around 350 EUR, it's not cheap but very powerful, can be operated permanently without a battery via power supply, and is very compact and robust
    - Inside my apartment without direct view outside, via O2 I usually get about 250 Mbit download and 50 Mbit upload; of course, the ping value is not like DSL
