summary = "Approximately two hours after uploading or publishing a video on YouTube, automatic subtitles are generated. These are often inaccurate, which also affects the translated subtitles based on them. YouTube offers internal tools for manual correction and adding subtitles in many other languages. However, correcting them can be time-consuming. Automatically translating subtitle files with a model like GPT-3.5-turbo is an alternative. Unfortunately, I encountered issues with it, likely due to user error, which will be resolved soon."
