summary = "When traveling to dangerous areas, it's advisable to carry a so-called decoy wallet or throwaway wallet. This contains some cash and expired credit cards to satisfy thieves and distract them from the valuable wallet. Similarly, it is safest to make valuable digital data invisible. With the free open-source program VeraCrypt, I create a secret vault on a USB stick: a hidden container within an outer container. This inner, secret container is encrypted with a cascade of AES, Serpent, and Twofish, and is suitable for storing passwords and copies of important documents."
