In this guide, I demonstrate how to set up an online store using WooCommerce—a cost-effective alternative to Shopify. We register an affordable .store domain with Namecheap (around €2 annually for the first year) and set up a WooCommerce instance on Linode for just €5 per month. Additionally, we configure custom name servers at the registrar, add an SSL certificate via the LISH console, and within about 30 minutes, we have a first look at the demo shop mjmrozek.store.

WooCommerce is a good and affordable alternative to Shopify. You can find a detailed comparison on [hostpress.de/blog/der-e-commerce-vergleich-woocommerce-vs-shopify](https://hostpress.de/blog/der-e-commerce-vergleich-woocommerce-vs-shopify).

I recommend WooCommerce for small and medium-sized shops, provided you are willing to invest a bit more time in the setup. With a .store domain, SSL, backups, and scalable hosting near customers, my solution costs about 9 EUR per month (domain long-term 1 EUR, email 1 EUR, hosting 5 EUR, backups 2 EUR). If the shop grows, performance can be adjusted quickly, though with additional costs.

- **Domain**
  - Register a domain with a registrar like namecheap.com
    - .store TLDs are currently on sale and are suitable for online stores
    - Use discounts, disable automatic renewal, and initially book for only one year; decide later about extensions depending on success
    - After successful registration, switch to Linode

- **Hosting**
  - Linode (Akamai) is comparable to AWS but cheaper and more user-friendly
    - You can implement many different projects via the Marketplace
    - Linode offers a $100 startup credit, which allows you to try almost everything for 60 days
    - Costs are calculated hourly, so you can experiment without worry
      - If a project is canceled after one day, costs only incur for that day
    - Create an account and switch to the **MARKETPLACE**
    - Search for "woocommerce"
    - Fill in the fields (my suggestion: xx_YOUR INITIALS instead of "mjm")
      - **Email:** Your email address for the SSL certificate
      - **Stack:** LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) for online stores
      - **Admin username:** au_yourinitials
      - **WordPress database user:** wdbu_mjm
      - **WordPress database name:** wdbn_mjm
      - **Limited sudo user:** lsu_mjm
      - **SSL:** Deactivate, as later access will be through the LISH console
      - **Image:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer
      - **Region:** Close to the expected customers
      - **Plan:** Initially, a Nanode 1 GB (Shared CPU) for $5 per month is sufficient
      - **Details:**
        - **Linode Label:** Prefix the shop name (e.g., "myshop.store_woocommerce…")
        - **Tags:** Use any tags for organization
        - **Root Password:** Remember a unique, secure password (e.g., "hit-apple-clearout-943!")
      - Save everything via screenshot or notes
      - Enable backups at your discretion
      - **CREATE LINODE** and wait until the status changes to "running"
    - Switch to **DOMAINS** in the dashboard
      - **Primary**
      - **Domain:** Your domain (e.g., "mjmrozek.store")
      - **SOA Email:** Your email address
      - **Insert Default Records:** Select the label used earlier
      - Copy the first entry under "NS Record," e.g., "ns1.linode.com"

- **Domain**
  - Select your acquired domain
  - **Custom NS:** Change the nameservers to:
    - ns1.linode.com
    - ns2.linode.com
    - ns3.linode.com
    - ns4.linode.com
    - ns5.linode.com
  - A Google search for "Registrar (your registrar) + change nameserver / custom name server" might be helpful
  - Changes may take several hours

- **Browser - New Tab**
  - Access the domain
  - Ignore security risks (we lack SSL, hence no https and warning, but we know we are accessing our own site)
  - myshop.store/wp-login.php

- **Linode**
  - Select the instance
  - **LISH Console**
  - Log in as "root"
  - Use `cat /home/lsu_mjm/.credentials` (replace "lsu_mjm") for the WordPress admin password
  - Use the password for myshop.store/wp-login.php

- **Browser**
  - Address: myshop.store/wp-login.php
    - **User:** au_yourinitials
    - **PW:** Output from the LISH console
    - **WordPress Dashboard:** Change settings
      - **General:**
        - **WordPress Address (URL):** https://myshop.store
        - **Site Address (URL):** https://myshop.store
        - Save changes

- **SSL**
  - **Linode**
    - Select the instance
    - **LISH**

      - Run the following commands:
        - `sudo apt update`
        - `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`
        - `sudo certbot --nginx -d mjmrozek.store -d www.mjmrozek.store` (replace "mjmrozek.store" with your domain)
      - **exit** and close the console

- Visit `https://myshop.store` in the browser; if issues arise, clear the cache or use incognito mode
  - **WordPress Dashboard**
    - **Appearance**
      - Change the theme to Twenty Twenty-One for further customization
    - Click the house icon on the top left and "Shop" for a first look at the store
