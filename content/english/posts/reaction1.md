It’s morning. I’m in my small, cozy attic apartment. The first coffee of the day has been made and sits next to me in a large mug labeled “Crisis Manager.” I’ll drink it shortly, as I’ve just had a large amount of vegetable juice and am now quite full – too full, even for a single sip of coffee.

Today, I must draft a rough version of my text on meta-skills. The main thing is to write something; I can’t postpone this task any longer. But where do I start? My thoughts bounce around. Before discussing the videos saved as a YouTube playlist, I want to explore where my interest in this topic originated.

An old black-and-white photo shows my grandfather’s garden. In the background, there’s a small house, a paved path down the middle, and vegetable patches on either side. A toddler is walking towards the camera on this path, stumbling and reaching forward. The child seems joyful, enthusiastic, and curious.

We’re walking along a stream. Only Karsten has rubber boots on. Ahead of us is a warning sign. It depicts a tidal wave and a helpless-looking man stumbling, about to be swept away. There’s a tree with roots reaching to the water’s edge, a thick canopy overhead; sunbeams sporadically break through. Behind, there’s a building, windows facing out, and in the top right corner is my classroom. Mrs. Derendorf sends Eva and me out into the hallway to explain something to each other. Back in my seat, in the back-left corner, the class seems to be over. Students in front of me turn around, looking at me, laughing; I must’ve been daydreaming. Mrs. Derendorf smiles at me, speaking of the deep contemplation of a philosopher.

It’s already noon, yet I’m still in bed. It’s uncomfortable. The window is slightly open and dimmed. Periodically, I can hear the train. It comes from the south, from Cologne, stops briefly at the sole station in Langenfeld, and continues towards Düsseldorf. Its operational noises don’t bother me at all. On the contrary, I’ve become so accustomed to them that I miss them when I sleep elsewhere.

The alarm rings again. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve hit the snooze button. Now, I stay awake. My arms are crossed behind my head, serving as an awkward cushion, so I don’t have to stare at the ceiling, allowing my gaze to wander around the room. No, it hasn’t been enough rest. I shift to my side, curling into a fetal position, and aim to fall asleep one last time. Suddenly, I hear the front door slam from downstairs. My mother has returned from work. It’s already 2:00 pm, and I need to get moving.

Gathering my courage, I move to my desk, switch on my new architect’s lamp, and ponder for a while. My eyes settle on the bookshelf. I don’t have many books yet. Most were school books, and I had to read them. Slowly, I’m adjusting to the idea that there’s no book I can’t read; the choices are mine, and I can determine what I read, when, and how. There’s Joyce’s “Ulysses,” mentioned by one of the Gilmore Girls, “Moby Dick” because Captain Jean-Luc quotes it, Nietzsche’s essential works, because I’ve always liked the sound of his name, and also Aristotle’s “Metaphysics,” because the title sounds impressive. I decide to tackle it once again, still barely understanding it. And that’s a good thing. Otherwise, the author might have to learn from me. I aim to read for at least 30 minutes before heading downstairs. Only after reading a few focused pages will I have earned my first coffee.

A short while later, in the kitchen, my mother, seated around the corner in the living room, greets me without us seeing each other. She’s relaxed and out of the blue asks if I’d like to hear a riddle. She received it from her boss, couldn’t solve it, and is curious to see how I fare. It goes, “22 + 4 = 2”. That’s all the information I get. Anything more would be a hint, making it easier for me, but then I couldn’t claim to have solved it on my own.

The riddle is compact, short, easy to remember; I can take it with me. I have to leave now. Currently, I’m working in a warehouse, the main hub of a supermarket chain. In a hall, the size of several soccer fields, I operate a pallet truck, colloquially known as an “ant.” The job is mostly mechanical, almost doable in my sleep, leaving ample time to think. For instance, about the riddle, mother’s boss – maybe it has something to do with soccer. After all, two teams consist of 22 players, but what do I do with the 2 and… My gaze catches everything as I navigate the aisles. I’ve now spent three decades on this planet, having experienced pre-school years filled with bedtime stories, rules, commandments, experiences, elementary school, high school, further training – though most learning happens outside of school and work – and now, faced with a “child’s riddle,” I’m clueless.

Some people collect stamps, others cars, and I’ve primarily chosen books, documents, and texts. While I was leisurely browsing on YouTube, I stumbled upon a video related to riddles or, more broadly, problem-solving techniques and saved it in a playlist named “Meta.” Over time, about 250 videos accumulated in this list, and now I want to briefly discuss each of them. The format will be a reaction video. By the end, we’ll have a neat overview. In a second segment, I’ll similarly, in brief, discuss all the articles I’ve saved in Pocket. Thirdly, I’ll go through all the texts I’ve saved as PDFs. I plan to conclude this series by discussing my top 10 favorites, regardless of whether they’re books, videos, or online texts.

Sometimes, an item on the list isn’t directly related to a problem-solving technique. Perhaps I found someone inspiring, something motivating, or maybe I wasn’t careful about which playlist the video was saved in. However, the primary theme should be meta-skills!

Let’s get started:
