**A Fracture:**  
My little sister looks at me with a peculiar expression, holds two connected track pieces, and threatens to break them if I don’t pick her up. I suffer a hernia, but I still hold her. The Christ child focuses only on me. I don’t feel any pain.
My mother chides, “Don’t kick your socks onto the wardrobe again!”
I simply lose interest in playing with the toy train. Rather, I’m still enamored by the toy, but fear currently dominates my emotions.
My father places me on his lap. I dislike it, so I slide onto a chair. He then explains that even minor cuts on the ear bleed profusely. Meanwhile, my gaze shifts between him and the overflowing aquarium. There are small fish in it. Regrettably, I fed them with an entire loaf of bread.
Something inside of me has broken. Hence, I’m scared, deathly scared, and wonder about heaven. My answer leads to doubt and isolation.
Something cold and sticky flows into my nose. It feels like I’m doing a handstand underwater. I’m on the brink of drowning, yet I breathe deeply and see hazily. Someone opens the bathroom door. I can’t recognize the intruder, but I feel the pressure of their hand on my neck. Sounds, like chatter, reach my ears.

**What will you do, Jack?**  
As it gets dark and silent, my breathing becomes shallow. I close one door and open another. Many behave this way here. I feel better when I fall asleep. Sometimes, I consciously dream before sleep, feeling content before consciousness slips away, and I simply observe. I often wake up tired and usually start the day in the same manner. After a restful night away from the sun, I feel rejuvenated. But my mind craves nourishment, which lies beyond its realm of thought. Though trapped in flesh, I look around in confusion. I hesitate in making decisions, be it about clothing or food. I enjoy watching time exert its influence. Thus, I don’t decide alone but let time and the clock hands pull me along. Dreaming matters to me. Occasionally, I wish I could sleep for days on end. However, nightmares filled with blurred childhood memories, deep waters, and strange encounters with fat geese feel like a thorn in my neck. Geese can warn against strangers as loudly as guard dogs. Excessive consumption of fatty foods and bananas leads to severe heartburn. The stomach acid seeks escape, just as my thoughts want to break free. The only remedy then is to sleep sitting up. It keeps the acid at bay, but not the vivid thoughts threatening to overwhelm me.

**The Tank:**  
The constant, sometimes week-long, forced sleep deprivation makes me sleep deeply and dream a lot. As I fight for air in a water-filled container, I often risk drowning. They feed me through a tube because I refuse to eat.
Thus, they also feed my fantasies. These haunt me in sleep. I sit in my cell, supporting my head with my hands, not truly living but merely existing through their force.

**Mother:**  
The animal I see is strong and tamed by humans, so it serves them. It seems to invite me to enter fertile land to sow, plow, harvest, and feed it with good hay. I cherish this thought and will ponder on it as I fall asleep. Fatigue overwhelms me, and only then do I notice the rider lighting a cigarette. He looks at me and explains that this land isn’t suitable for cultivation. “It’s a holly forest,” he says. I lower my head, looking at the painted arrow meant to guide me, and start swaying. Stumbling, I fall onto my resting place, close the door, and see my mother. She disapproves of the friends who always tug at my clothes. “Pull yourself together, Mo,” she says.
